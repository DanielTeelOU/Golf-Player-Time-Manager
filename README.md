Senior Capstone Project for CS/IT majors at Oakland University. Project 1.
## The web application can be found at either of the following domains
* https://golf-player-time-management.firebaseapp.com
* https://golf-player-time-management.web.app
## Project Description
This software will have two components: a cloud based player management application and mobile phone application.
## Requirements
### The cloud app will do the following
* Track players position on a virtual golf course utilizing an application on the players phones that
transmits GPS location information ✅
* It will utilize a queuing algorithm to optimize playing time by calculating wait times ✅
* Players devices application will be able to notify cloud applications for services or assistance ✅
* Provide helpful hints about the course based on the location of the player ✅
* System shall allow players to login and register their device ✅
* System shall monitor player behavior and provide player dashboard ✅
### The mobile phone application (Android) will do the following

* Players login and register at golf ranges ✅
* Players enables GPS and secure connection with cloud based app ✅
* Players app displays progress on the course, playing time, Warnings about playing speed, and
request to allow playthrough ✅

## Summary
There will be two components that serve two main functions:
* The Cloud App will be a web application that will serve as an Administrator Dashboard that allows course owners to edit the course's information (Geofence the holes and set specific information for each hole), monitor players' behaviour on the course, and receive requests from players
* The Mobile App will be an Android application that will allow players to play anonymously (see course information and make requests) or play as a registered member. As a registered member players will be able to see their game history as well as see course information and make requests
